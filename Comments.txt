Additional tabs don't update the tab name

Need a status bar to show when the program is loading information or when something has gone wrong.

Can't load the link http://www.vice.com/tag/RSS.

What's up with dummyString in SystemTrayListener?

can't read multiple articles at the same time(the popout wondows is disabling the main windows)

The text size is permanently small

Some articles have no body at all, it might be useful to filter them out 

extra column, so if all columns except one are minimized, it should stretch to fill the screen
	-columns aren't scaled

popout article - crashes....

We like the notification at the bottom when a feed is refreshed/new article appears

Lots of comments in article.java - fix with good variable/method names!
	-same with feed

readlink in rssThread - should use .equals not ==
